<h3> Funktionsweise</h3>
<p>The useful property of a circular buffer is that it does not need to have its elements shuffled around when one is consumed. </p>
<p>(If a non-circular buffer were used then it would be necessary to shift all elements when one is consumed.) In other words,</p>
<p>the circular buffer is well-suited as a FIFO buffer while a standard, non-circular buffer is well suited as a LIFO buffer.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Circular buffering makes a good implementation strategy for a queue that has fixed maximum size. Should a maximum size be </p>
<p>adopted for a queue, then a circular buffer is a completely ideal implementation; all queue operations are constant time. However, expanding a circular buffer requires </p>
<p>shifting memory, which is comparatively costly. For arbitrarily expanding queues, a linked list approach may be preferred instead.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In some situations, overwriting circular buffer can be used, e.g. in multimedia. If the buffer is used as the bounded buffer in the producer-consumer problem then it is </p>
<p>probably desired for the producer (e.g., an audio generator) to overwrite old data if the consumer (e.g., the sound card) is unable to momentarily keep up. Also, the LZ77</p>
<p>family of lossless data compression algorithms operates on the assumption that strings seen more recently in a data stream are more likely to occur soon in the stream. </p>
<p>Implementations store the most recent data in a circular buffer.</p>
